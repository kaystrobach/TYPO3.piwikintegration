Administrative functions in backendmodule
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Backendmodule is devided into 3 parts:

**Overview** : I would call it dashboard, it's simply a page which
shows the most important statistics: Visitors, Frequency, Pages and
Keywords.

**Direct Statistics Access** : Takes you to the original Matomo control
panel, where you can find all statitics gathered by Matomo and also
access the Admin section. This part can be skinned with the Matomo
plugin `TYPO3Menu (found in Admin page on Plugin tab). <http://kay-

local Matomo URL along with the , JavaScriptTrackingCode display for
use in external tools.
