From 1.x to 2.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Simply upgrade via TER, update the TS Setup with the new Option, after
opening the BE Module Matomo gets installed and you're done.

Don't forget to install EXT:piwik for automated adding of the
trackingcode. → Please check your page for the trackingcode as non
logged in BE user, as EXT:piwik from version 2.x won't log
authenticated BE Users.
