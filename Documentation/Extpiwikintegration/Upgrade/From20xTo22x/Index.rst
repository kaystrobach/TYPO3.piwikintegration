From 2.0.x to 2.2.x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is a new Matomo Plugin called TYPO3Menu which is shipped with
version 2.1.0.

This plugin switches the gui of Matomo into a more TYPO3 like style.
You need to activate it manually, as EXT:piwikintegration tries to not
touch your config if not really needed. The shipped Extensions have
the same Version as EXT:piwikintegration by architecture. That makes
it easy for you to find the correct plugins.
